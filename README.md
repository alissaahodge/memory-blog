# Memory Blog `built using MERN Stack`

This project was built on the MERN stack. (MongoDb, Express ,React, Node)
## About This Project

This is a blogging website where users can create an account, login, upload a photo, some details/body of their blog post and also tags. You can receive likes on these posts. 
This project was done to continue strengthening my skills/knowledge in React but in future I will continue adding on to this project.

Ps. This can also be used as a base for other MERN stack projects as it has Authentication (JWT & Google Auth) and other pieces that would be used when starting up a MERN project.
